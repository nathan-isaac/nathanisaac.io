Hi, I'm Nathan.

Iâ€™m a software engineer who loves to craft software. I enjoy working with a variety of technologies and tools. I work 
with React, Typescript, and Kotlin at my day job. But I am also working on a few personal projects that use Svelte, 
Rust, and Go.

I have a passion for building Local First software. I have yet to release a local first application but am working on a 
few projects that will be released soon.
